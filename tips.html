<p> "Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But
there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But
your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this
phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing
that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and
the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going
through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this
than anyone I've ever met. It's gonna take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just gotta fight your way through."

<p> "What though the radiance which was once so bright<br>
Be now for ever taken from my sight<br>
Though nothing can bring back the hour<br>
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower<br>
We will grieve not, rather find<br>
Strength in what remains behind ..."
